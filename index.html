        I’m a multidisciplinary artist and creative producer with over 10 years of experience in video production, photography, and editing, creating content that blends visual storytelling with artistic impact. I’ve worked with small businesses, personal brands, and cultural organizations to craft engaging photo and video content for websites, campaigns, and social media platforms. My work spans from long & short-form story driven videos to professional photography and collage-based visuals, often combining analog textures with digital fluency. As the founder of Poetonic, I also produce original art-led content that resonates with online audiences, drawing from a strong background in both traditional media and web3 culture.
