## Getting Started

To set up the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `public/index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.
4. Add your own photos to the `images` directory and videos to the `videos` directory.
